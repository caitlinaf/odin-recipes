        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
             <li>4 tbsp coriander seeds</li>
             <li>3 tbsp cumin seeds</li>
             <li>2 tbsp black peppercorns</li>
             <li>2 tbsp basmati rice</li>
             <li>1 tbsp cardamom pods <em>you will only use the seeds from the pods, about 12 - 15 pods</em></li>
             <li>3 tsp whole cloves <em>about 10 -15 cloves</em></li>
             <li>2 tsp black mustard seeds</li>
             <li>1 tsp fennel seeds</li>
            </ul>
         
         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Place the rice on a dry non stick pan. Heat over medium heat until the rice starts to turn light brown.</li>
            <li>Remove the seeds from the cardamom pods and discard the husks.</li>
            <li>Add the rest of the spices and the cardamom seeds to the rice, and pan roast for a further 3 - 5 minutes until the spices start to brown, toast and become aromatic.</li>
            <li>Keep moving the pan to prevent the spices from burning. Also adjust the cook times according to your stove and pan, to avoid burning the spices. Or your curry powder will be bitter.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and let the spices cool down.</li>
            <li>Once the spices cool down - use a spice grinder (or a mortar and pestle) to grind the spice mix into a powder in batches and mix well. Store in an air tight container.</li>
            <li>Use as needed.</li>
         </ol>
