               <li>4 tsp black pepper whole</li>
                <li>6 cardamom pods seeds crushed (only the seeds)</li>
                <li>1 heaped teaspoon of <a href="sri-lankan-curry-powder.html" target="_blank">Sri Lankan Roasted Curry Powder</a></li>
                <li>½ tsp salt</li>
                <li>¼ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>½ tsp cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
                <li>3 tsp tamarind paste</li>
            </ul>
    
        <h4>Curry</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>2 jalapeno peppers sliced</li>
            <li>1 inch of peeled ginger minced</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves minced</li>
            <li>½ medium onion chopped finely</li>
            <li>1 tbsp lemon juice (optional)</li>
            <li>2-3 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
         </ul>
         
         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Cut the pork into ½ – 1 inch cubes. If the pork chops have bones you can add those to the curry as well, as they add more flavour.</li>
            <li>Crush the cardamom pod seeds into a powder and mix it with the black pepper, curry powder, salt, cinnamon, cayenne pepper. Next, crush and mix all of this together using a mortar and pestle.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tbsp of this spice mix, the tamarind paste, and 1 tbsp oil to the cut pork and mix to coat. Leave to marinate for a few hours (up to 8 hours/overnight)</li>
            <li>The next day, bring the meat to room temperature before cooking.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tbsp of oil in a saucepan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the bay leaves and ginger and onions, and saute till the onions become translucent. Add the garlic and sliced jalapeno peppers and saute for another 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add the marinated pork and sugar and stir to mix well. Add about ½ cup of water and bring this to a boil.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat to medium-low and let it simmer for 1 hour. Check on the curry, and add extra water if it dries out.</li>
            <li>Taste and add more salt and some lemon juice – only if needed.</li>
            <li>You can serve this curry immediately, but it tastes better after it has rested for a little while. Even better the next day!</li>
         </ol>
